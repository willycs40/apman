* move to a yaml config file. specify this as package data so it gets installed with the lib
* or just leave it as a config.py for now?
* remove the concept of the data model stuff? e.g. models.py
* add tests with various test packages
	* where should the logging go?
	* things to test:
		* a timeout package
		* an exception package
		* a successful package
		* emailing on success
			* to global and package parties
		* test the cd function
		* test runscript...
		* make logging more best practice
* move email to email.py
* add a 'scripts' command, to allow the use of apman as a command line tool (when in the virtualenv) - then jobs can be scheduled with it
